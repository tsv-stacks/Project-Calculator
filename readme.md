# Calculator

### Live Page: https://tsv-stacks.github.io/Project-Calculator/

A simple calculator app built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. This app allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two numbers. This was one of the first apps I built and helped me learn more about arrays and array manipulation.

## Installation

To use the calculator, simply clone this repository to your local machine and open `index.html` in your browser.

```bash
 git clone https://github.com/tsv-stacks/Project-Calculator
 cd Project-Calculator
 open index.html
```

## Future updates

- add keyboard support
- code % button
- fix number and pressing equal !== NaN
